Deep Q-Learning (DQN) is an extension of Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. It uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function, which represents the expected future rewards for an agent's actions in a given state.

### Key Features:
- **Experience Replay:** Stores past experiences to break correlation between consecutive samples and stabilize training.
- **Target Network:** Uses a separate network to calculate target Q-values to improve stability.

### Applications:
- Game playing (e.g., Atari games)
- Robotic control
- Navigation tasks
